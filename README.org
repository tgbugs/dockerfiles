A collection of docker files that are useful for reproducing a variety

* Quickstart

* Dev
*There are no docker files in this repository!?!?*

Correct! All docker files live in the literate source file [[./source.org][source.org]].

You can generate them by running src_bash{./source.org tangle}, but
*do not edit docker files in this repository directly!* If you do any
changes will be overwritten when you run src_bash{./source.org build}
or any other command that has a tangle step.

If you need to make changes please edit [[./source.org][source.org]] and tangle/run.
